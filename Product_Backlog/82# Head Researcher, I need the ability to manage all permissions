Background:
"it’s very important that we have different types of people that can access
parts of the system. There are participants, obviously, who need to be able to carry out questionnaires
(if a study has them) but there should also be different “researcher” roles. A PR (principal researcher)
should have full access to their own experiments, a CoR (co-researcher) should only have access to
parts that the PR says they should, and me (as the lab manager) should have access to everything and
also be able to manage users (add them, reset passwords etc.)"
