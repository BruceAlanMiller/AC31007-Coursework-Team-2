As Head Researcher, I need a confirmation page showing space for name and 
contact information of the researcher, so that I can thank the participants upon completing a questionnaire
Label: Deliver Last (Low Risk/Low Value) 
MOSCOW: Should
Story Points: 3
Notes
There is enough space for 1-2 paragraphs of contact information

Background:  After participants complete the questionnaire, a confirmation page should be displayed, this is to confirm that the form 
has been submitted and allows for the researcher to leave a message saying thankyou along with any other relevant information that
the participants need to know.  the researcher has asked for space for roughly two paragraphs as well as allocated space for
email address and contact information.  In this instance email and contact information will be kept as a John/Jane Doe and 
paragraphs just to contain sample data, such as Lorem ipsum.
