Background:
"in our meeting you said it would be good if users can see what they have answered to a 
questionnaire. Did you mean a sort of confirmation page before finally submitting the answers. 
Or a page where they can look back at all the different questionnaires they have answered?"

"A confirmation page, or a page to review their answers is what I meant yeah"
