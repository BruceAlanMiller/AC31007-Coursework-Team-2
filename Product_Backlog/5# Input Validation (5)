Background:  so as to insure maximum effectiveness of the questionnaire, we need to make sure that people cant enter
numbers in a text only field, and text into a numbers only field.  Alerting the participant to mistakes in the data
entry would allow the participant to re-enter data, rather than attempting to submit a form that cant be entered into 
the database.
