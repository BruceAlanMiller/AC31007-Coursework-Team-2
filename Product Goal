Definition of Done, Project Goal:
The end product will be an interface that allows researchers to design their own questionnaires 
containing multiple types of data-input, as well as incorporating multiple choice questions that 
the researcher can supply options for.  All answers will be fed directly into the database, 
the output from the database will consist of multiple views including graphs and other forms of 
visualisation.  A database management interface will be created to allow for principal researchers 
and lab managers to modify both the data recorded from the questionnaires and any saved information 
about the researchers themselves, including which experiments belong to which researcher and who has access to them.

A form will be designed for the virtual reality researcher that incorporates the ability to playback video footage 
and add comments at particular time intervals, these comments and time-stamps will be saved to a database.  
Along side comments, the researcher will be able to set a number of values for drop-down boxes that he/she can 
use to further describe the footage.  this will then output to an interface where the researcher can see the notes 
they have made as well as have the ability to compare separate pieces of footage using the values set in drop-down boxes.  
They will also have the ability to see visualisations of the comparisons.  The ability to synchronise video footage from 
multiple cameras will be developed as a separate part of the researcher interface.
